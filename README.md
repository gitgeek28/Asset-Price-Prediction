# 📈 Asset Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the future price of a stock (Google) using a combination of traditional and modern machine learning approaches including LSTM (deep learning) and XGBoost.

## 🚀 Objective

To build and compare predictive models for stock price forecasting using:
- Time Series Analysis
- Supervised Learning Models
- Deep Learning Architectures (LSTM)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Google Stock Price - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/google-stock-price-train)
- **Description**: Historical stock prices of Google including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras
- ARIMA  

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Train-test split

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visual trends in closing price
   - Moving average smoothing

3. **Model Implementation**
   - 📦 XGBoost Regression
   - 🔁 LSTM Neural Network
   - 📉 ARIMA Model for traditional forecasting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE
   - Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices

## 📈 Results

- LSTM shows strong temporal learning ability and performs better on longer-term sequences.
- XGBoost captures short-term trends effectively.
- RMSE and MAE were used to compare models.
